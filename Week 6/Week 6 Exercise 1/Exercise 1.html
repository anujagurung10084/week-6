<p style="font-size: 20px;">Team Minato! Team Minato was a team led by Minato Namikaze and composed of Kakashi Hatake, Obito Uchiha, and Rin Nohara.<br>
During the Third Shinobi World War, Team Minato was assigned to destroy the Kannabi Bridge in Kusagakure in order to cut off Iwagakure's supply line in its war with Konoha. Kakashi, recently promoted to j≈çnin, was given leadership of the mission while Minato assisted the war effort elsewhere. Rin was captured by Iwa-nin during the course of the mission and Kakashi and Obito successfully rescued her. However, their escape was impeded by a cave-in and Obito's body was crushed by the falling boulders, rendering him unable to move. With other Iwa forces approaching, Obito gave his left Sharingan to Kakashi as a gift and then bade him to escape with Rin. They did so and Minato arrived in time to help fight off the Iwa-nin, but it was too late for them to save Obito. Minato helped them destroy the bridge before they returned to Konoha to mourn his loss.
